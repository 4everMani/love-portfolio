    One day, I won’t just be sending you a Rose Day message…
    I’ll be waking up next to you, placing a real rose in your hand,
    and thanking God that you’re mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ananya, your heart is so soft, so full of love.
    And I don’t take that lightly.
    I know how deeply you feel things.
    I know how much reassurance means to you.
    And I want you to know — I am here to protect that softness forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are not just my love.<br>
    You are the woman I see in my future.<br>
    The one I want to build a home with.<br>
    The one whose tears I want to wipe.<br>
    The one whose smile I want to be responsible for.
  </p>

  <p>
    On this Rose Day, I promise you something bigger than a rose —
    I promise patience.
    I promise care.<br>
    I promise to never make you feel alone in your emotions.<br>
    I promise to choose you every single day, even on ordinary days.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ananya, you are my heart’s safest decision.<br>
    And I can’t wait for the day I call you my wife. 🌹❤️
  </p>
