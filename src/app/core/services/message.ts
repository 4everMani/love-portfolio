  <p>
    One day, I won’t just be sending you a Rose Day message…
    I’ll be waking up next to you, placing a real rose in your hand,
    and thanking God that you’re mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ananya, your heart is so soft, so full of love.
    And I don’t take that lightly.
    I know how deeply you feel things.
    I know how much reassurance means to you.
    And I want you to know — I am here to protect that softness forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are not just my love.<br>
    You are the woman I see in my future.<br>
    The one I want to build a home with.<br>
    The one whose tears I want to wipe.<br>
    The one whose smile I want to be responsible for.
  </p>

  <p>
    On this Rose Day, I promise you something bigger than a rose —
    I promise patience.
    I promise care.<br>
    I promise to never make you feel alone in your emotions.<br>
    I promise to choose you every single day, even on ordinary days.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ananya, you are my heart’s safest decision.<br>
    And I can’t wait for the day I call you my wife. 🌹❤️

  <p>
    We’ve met only once… but my heart has never been this certain.
  </p>

  <p>
    There’s something about you that feels different. Real. Rare.
    And I don’t want to ignore that feeling.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t just like you.<br>
    I see you in my future.<br>
    I want to grow with you, protect your heart,
    stand beside you, and build something lasting and beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn’t just a sweet message.<br>
    It’s a sincere promise of intention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ananya, will you let me be yours — and allow me to choose you every single day? 🌹❤️

  CHOCOLATE: `
  <div>
  <p>
    Chocolate is sweet, soft, and comforting…
    but even that feels less compared to the warmth you bring into my life.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are the kind of sweetness that isn’t loud —
    it’s gentle, deep, and lasting.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I think about you, I don’t just think about smiles and cute moments.
    I think about a life filled with care, understanding,
    and holding each other through everything.
  </p>

  <p>
    On this Chocolate Day, I don’t just want to give you something sweet —
    I want to promise you a love that feels safe.<br>
    A love that reassures you.<br>
    A love that grows richer with time, just like the finest chocolate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ananya, you are not just sweetness in my life —
    you are value, depth, and the woman I want beside me in every season. 🍫❤️
